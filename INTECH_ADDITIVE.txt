b) Linked List - The link shows a program to find the nth element of a linked list.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/

Find a way to find the kth to the last element of linked list ( assume length of linked list is not
known)
Bonus 1:
Can you minimize the number of times you run through the loop.



solution:-


The task is to find the kth to the last element of a linked list, and the length of the linked list is not known. The goal is to minimize the number of times you traverse the linked list.

The approach used in the code is known as the "two-pointer" approach or "runner" technique.

Two pointers, slowPtr and fastPtr, are initialized to the head of the linked list.
fastPtr is moved k nodes ahead. This step is crucial for finding the kth to the last element.
Move Both Pointers Simultaneously

The data of the node where slowPtr is pointing is printed. This node represents the kth to the last element

TIME COMPLEXITY:
1. 
This loop has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.

2.After moving fastPtr k nodes ahead, both slowPtr and fastPtr move together to the end of the linked list.
This loop also has a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.

Auxiliary Space:-The auxiliary space complexity of the provided solution is O(1)



class Node {
    constructor(d) {
        this.data = d;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    constructor(d) {
        this.head = d;
    }
    printKthFromLast(k) {
        let slowPtr = this.head;
        let fastPtr = this.head;



        

        // Move fastPtr k nodes ahead
        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (fastPtr == null) {
                console.log("Invalid value of k");
                return;
            }
            fastPtr = fastPtr.next;
        }



        // Move both pointers until fastPtr reaches the end
        while (fastPtr != null) {
            slowPtr = slowPtr.next;
            fastPtr = fastPtr.next;
        }




        // slowPtr is now k nodes from the end
        console.log(slowPtr.data);
    }

    push(new_data) {
        let new_node = new Node(new_data);
        new_node.next = this.head;
        this.head = new_node;
    }
}




// Driver program to test above methods
let llist = new LinkedList();
llist.push(20);
llist.push(4);
llist.push(15);
llist.push(35);

llist.printKthFromLast(3); // Output: 2

let llist2 = new LinkedList();
llist2.push(20);
llist2.push(4);
llist2.push(15);
llist2.push(35);

llist2.printKthFromLast(4); // Output: 35




Algorithm:

1.  Node Class - 
Define a Node class to represent a node in the linked list.
Each node has a data field to store the value and a next field to point to the next node.

class Node {
    constructor(d) {
        this.data = d;
        this.next = null;
    }
}



2. Linked List Class:

Define a LinkedList class that has a head field representing the starting node of the linked list.

class LinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
    }
}



3. printKthFromLast Method:

Define a method printKthFromLast(k) in the LinkedList class to find and print the kth to the last element.
Use two pointers, slowPtr and fastPtr, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

printKthFromLast(k) {
    let slowPtr = this.head;
    let fastPtr = this.head;

Move fastPtr k nodes ahead:    

    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (fastPtr == null) {
            console.log("Invalid value of k");
            return;
        }
        fastPtr = fastPtr.next;
    }


Move both pointers one node at a time until fastPtr reaches the end.
    while (fastPtr != null) {
        slowPtr = slowPtr.next;
        fastPtr = fastPtr.next;
    }


4. push Method:

Define a push method to insert a new node at the beginning of the linked list.

push(new_data) {
    let new_node = new Node(new_data);
    new_node.next = this.head;
    this.head = new_node;
}

5. Driver Code:

Create an instance of LinkedList.
Insert elements at the beginning using the push method.
Call printKthFromLast method with different values of k to test the solution.


let llist = new LinkedList();
llist.push(20);
llist.push(4);
llist.push(15);
llist.push(35);
llist.printKthFromLast(3); 


real world use case:- Consider a production line where products are assembled, and each product is represented by a unique identifier. The assembly line produces products sequentially, and the order in which they are assembled is preserved in a linked list. The head of the linked list represents the most recently assembled product, and each node in the list corresponds to a product with a reference to the previously assembled product

Stack minimum- Details of stack data structure is available in
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/
Stack has functions of push and pop. Can you also add a function ‘min’ to the stack and it
should also execute in O(1).
If you are not aware of O(1), refer to some videos online. E.g.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation
Bonus 1 –
Explain one real world use case where stack is better used data structure than arrays.


solution:-

Yes, it is possible to add a 'min' function to the stack data structure and still execute it in O(1). The key is to use an additional stack that keeps track of the minimum element
to design a stack data structure that supports the standard push and pop operations, and additionally includes a min function that retrieves the minimum element from the stack in constant time, O(1)

class MinStack {
 constructor() {
    this.stack = [];
    this.minStack = [];
 }

 push(x) {
    this.stack.push(x);
    if (this.minStack.length === 0 || x <= this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
      this.minStack.push(x);
    }
 }

 pop() {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
    if (this.stack[this.stack.length - 1] === this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
      this.minStack.pop();
    }
    return this.stack.pop();
 }

 top() {
    if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
    return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
 }

 getMin() {
    if (this.minStack.length === 0) return null;
    return this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1];
 }
}



1.Constructor:

The class has a constructor that initializes two arrays: stack for storing the main elements and minStack for maintaining the minimum elements

constructor() {
   this.stack = [];
   this.minStack = [];
}



2.Push Operation:

The push method is used to add an element to the stack.
It pushes the element onto the main stack (this.stack).
If the minStack is empty or the new element is less than or equal to the current minimum, the element is also pushed onto the minStack.

push(x) {
   this.stack.push(x);
   if (this.minStack.length === 0 || x <= this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
      this.minStack.push(x);
   }
}



3.Pop Operation:

The pop method is used to remove and return the top element from the stack.
It checks if the element being popped is the current minimum, and if so, it also pops the top element from the minStack.

pop() {
   if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
   if (this.stack[this.stack.length - 1] === this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
      this.minStack.pop();
   }
   return this.stack.pop();
}



4.Top Operation:

The top method returns the top element of the stack without removing it

top() {
   if (this.stack.length === 0) return null;
   return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
}



APPROACH:The approach used in the MinStack implementation involves maintaining an auxiliary stack (minStack) to keep track of the minimum element in the main stack at any given time. The key idea is to update the minStack whenever a new element is pushed onto the main stack or when an element is popped from the main stack


time complexity: time complexity of all the operations (push, pop, top, getMin) in the MinStack implementation is constant, O(1). This is achieved by maintaining an auxiliary stack (minStack) that allows for the efficient retrieval of the minimum element


auxiliary space:
total auxiliary space complexity of the MinStack implementation, considering both the main stack and the auxiliary stack, is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack. While the push, pop, top, and getMin operations all have a time complexity of O(1), the space complexity is influenced by the size of the stack.


ALGORITHM:MinStack algorithm efficiently maintains the minimum element during push and pop operations by utilizing an auxiliary stack (minStack). This ensures that retrieving the minimum element (getMin) takes constant time (O(1)), while push, pop, and top operations also operate in constant time

real life use case: industrial automation system where sensors are used to monitor various parameters in a manufacturing environment, such as temperature, pressure, or humidity. Each sensor reading is associated with a timestamp and is continuously pushed onto a data stack

Real-time Monitoring
Alarm System
Efficient Retrieval

MinStack structure enhances the efficiency of tracking the minimum sensor reading, providing valuable insights and aiding in the rapid identification of critical situations in an industrial automation setting

 Given an array of integers representing the elevation of a roof structure at
various positions, each position is separated by a unit length, Write a program
to determine


the maximum amount of water that can be trapped between any two vertical lines of the roof is equal to the height of the shortest vertical line


function calculateWater(roof, numColumns) {
 let waterTrapped = 0;

 // Define left and right arrays
 let leftMax = [];
 let rightMax = [];

 // Fill left and right arrays
 leftMax[0] = roof[0];
 for (let i = 1; i < numColumns; i++) {
    leftMax[i] = Math.max(leftMax[i - 1], roof[i]);
 }

 rightMax[numColumns - 1] = roof[numColumns - 1];
 for (let i = numColumns - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    rightMax[i] = Math.max(rightMax[i + 1], roof[i]);
 }

 // Calculate the amount of water trapped
 for (let i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) {
    waterTrapped += Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - roof[i];
 }

 return waterTrapped;
}



 provided code efficiently calculates the amount of water trapped on a roof structure by precomputing the maximum heights to the left and right of each column. The three loops ensure that each column's contribution to the trapped water is considered, and the result is returned. This solution follows the dynamic programming approach

solution uses three loops:

The first loop fills the leftMax array, storing the maximum height to the left of each column.
The second loop fills the rightMax array, storing the maximum height to the right of each column.
The third loop calculates the amount of water trapped for each column and accumulates the result in the waterTrapped variable.

function calculateWater(roof, numColumns) {
    let waterTrapped = 0;

    // Define left and right arrays
    let leftMax = [];
    let rightMax = [];

    // Fill left array with the maximum height to the left of each column
    leftMax[0] = roof[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < numColumns; i++) {
        leftMax[i] = Math.max(leftMax[i - 1], roof[i]);
    }

    // Fill right array with the maximum height to the right of each column
    rightMax[numColumns - 1] = roof[numColumns - 1];
    for (let i = numColumns - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        rightMax[i] = Math.max(rightMax[i + 1], roof[i]);
    }

    // Calculate the amount of water trapped
    for (let i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) {
        waterTrapped += Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - roof[i];
    }

    return waterTrapped;
}

// Example usage:
const roofElevation = [2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3];
const numColumns = roofElevation.length;

const trappedWater = calculateWater(roofElevation, numColumns);
console.log("Amount of water trapped:", trappedWater);


Example Output:
For the input [2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3], the output will be

Amount of water trapped: 7

This indicates that 7 units of water will be trapped on the roof structure after heavy rainfall.


APRROACH:
1.Initialize two arrays, leftMax and rightMax, to store the maximum height to the left and right of each column, respectively.

let leftMax = [];
let rightMax = [];


2.Fill leftMax Array:

Iterate through the roof from left to right.
For each column, calculate the maximum height to the left and store it in the leftMax array.

leftMax[0] = roof[0];
for (let i = 1; i < numColumns; i++) {
    leftMax[i] = Math.max(leftMax[i - 1], roof[i]);
}


3.Fill rightMax Array:

Iterate through the roof from right to left.
For each column, calculate the maximum height to the right and store it in the rightMax array.

rightMax[numColumns - 1] = roof[numColumns - 1];
for (let i = numColumns - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    rightMax[i] = Math.max(rightMax[i + 1], roof[i]);
}


4.Calculate Water Trapped:

Iterate through the roof again.
For each column, calculate the amount of water trapped using the formula: Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - roof[i].
Accumulate the result in the waterTrapped variable


for (let i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) {
    waterTrapped += Math.min(leftMax[i], rightMax[i]) - roof[i];
}




TIME COMPLEXITY: solution has a linear time complexity, making it efficient for calculating the amount of water trapped on a roof structure.The dominant factor in terms of time complexity is the iteration over the columns, and the loops are not nested The algorithm processes each column once, and the time required scales linearly with the number of columns

Filling leftMax Array
Filling rightMax Array
Calculating Water Trapped


AUXIALIARY SPACE: Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of columns.
Space complexity: O(1) for these additional variables.


ALGORITHM OF CODE :

2.Fill leftMax Array
3.Fill rightMax Array

You will be given a list coin denominations that you can use to tender change to
your customers, find the most optimum way to tender the exact change to your
customers , the optimum is when you use the least number of coins.

given a number N, remove one digit and print the largest possible number.

E.g.
Why is the above solution part of a greedy algorithm?

19374

Answers:

9374



SOLUTION:

Problem Statement:
Given a list of coin denominations and a target amount to be tendered as change, find the most optimum way to tender the exact change to minimize the number of coins used


Explanation:


1.Greedy Algorithm:

A greedy algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
In the context of the coin change problem, a greedy approach would involve selecting the largest coin denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining change at each step

2.Dynamic Programming:

Dynamic programming helps in optimizing the solution by breaking down the problem into subproblems and solving them independently.
In the coin change problem, dynamic programming is used to build a table where each entry represents the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a specific amount


3.Scenarios Explained:

Starting with an amount of 7:
Greedy choice: Select the largest coin (5) first.
Remaining amount: 2
Greedy choice: Select the largest coin (2) for the remaining amount.
Optimum solution: [2, 5]
Dynamic programming allows us to calculate and store solutions for subproblems


Coin Change Problem:

function coinChange(coins, target) {
    // Sort coins in descending order for the greedy approach
    coins.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    const result = [];
    let remaining = target;

    for (const coin of coins) {
        while (remaining >= coin) {
            result.push(coin);
            remaining -= coin;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const coinDenominations = [1, 2, 5, 8, 10];
const changeToGive = 7;

const optimumChange = coinChange(coinDenominations, changeToGive);
console.log("Optimum Change:", optimumChange);



Remove One Digit for Largest Number:

function removeOneDigitForLargestNumber(number) {
    const numberStr = number.toString();
    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < numberStr.length; i++) {
        const modifiedNumberStr = numberStr.substring(0, i) + numberStr.substring(i + 1);
        const modifiedNumber = parseInt(modifiedNumberStr);
        result.push(modifiedNumber);
    }

    const largestNumber = Math.max(...result);
    return largestNumber;
}

// Example usage:
const originalNumber = 19374;
const largestNumberAfterRemoval = removeOneDigitForLargestNumber(originalNumber);
console.log("Largest Number After Removal:", largestNumberAfterRemoval);



APPROACH 
Coin Change Problem:

The approach involves a greedy algorithm that iteratively chooses the largest coin denominations to minimize the number of coins used for change.



TIME COMPLEXITY:

1.Sorting Step : Sorting the coin denominations in descending order has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of denominations

2.Greedy Algorithm:

The greedy algorithm iterates through the sorted denominations once, and at each step, it performs constant-time operations.
The overall time complexity of the greedy algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of denominations

Overall Time Complexity: O(n log n)



SPACE COMPLEXITY:
The dominant factor in terms of space complexity is the size of the result array.
Overall Space Complexity: O(n)

REAL LIFE USE CASE: Greedy Coin Change in Vending Machines
The goal is to design an efficient algorithm to give the optimal change when a customer inserts coins to make a purchase

the issue might be more complex, such as a bug in the compiler itself, or a memory leak that is causing unpredictable crashes. In such cases, it would be beneficial to seek help from other developers or communities, such as Stack Overflow, GitHub, or relevant programming language mailing lists.


Isolating the Cause:


Utilize the debugger: Attach a debugger to the source code and follow the execution flow. Set breakpoints in the code to pause the execution and inspect the values of the variables.


Reproducibility:

Try to identify any patterns or specific user actions that trigger the crashes.
Reproduce the issue consistently to narrow down potential causes.


Logging and Error Handling:

Enhance logging and error handling to capture more information when crashes occur.
Implement a global error handler to catch unhandled exceptions.


Browser Developer Tools:

Use browser developer tools to inspect console logs, network requests, and errors.
Set breakpoints and leverage debugging features to step through the code.


Memory Profiling:

Use memory profiling tools to identify memory leaks or excessive memory consumption.
Monitor memory usage over time and analyze patterns.


Code Review:

Perform a thorough code review, paying attention to error-prone areas.
Look for common programming pitfalls, such as infinite loops or improper error handling.


Code Splitting:

Consider breaking down the code into smaller modules and progressively isolate the issue.
Test each module independently to identify the part causing the crash.


Testing Environments:

Test the application in various environments and browsers to identify platform-specific issues.
Consider using virtual machines or different devices.


Operating System Interaction:

Explore how the application interacts with the operating system.
Check for compatibility issues with specific OS versions or configurations.


Concurrency and Parallelism:

Analyze how the application handles concurrency and parallelism.
Look for issues related to thread synchronization and parallel execution.


Low-Level Debugging:

Consider using low-level debugging tools or hardware-based debugging interfaces.
Investigate machine-level instructions to identify anomalies.


Power and Thermal Considerations:

In rare cases, crashes might be influenced by power or thermal conditions.
Monitor the system's power consumption and temperature during testing.

Random Variable : The application may be using some random variable, like random number generator or a specific time of the day or a user input etc which may be causing this.
Uninitialized Variable : May be there is some uninitialized variable, which takes an arbitrary value each time and those values are causing such drastic behavior.
Memory Leak : The program may have run out of memory, maybe heap overflow or something.
External Dependencies : The program may depend on some other application which is causing this.
Other process on machine : Maybe there are some other processes, running on machine causing it.
We can approach this problem by elimination, like close all other applications in the system or use some runtime tools to dig deeper when the problem occurs.
